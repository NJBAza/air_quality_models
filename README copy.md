# README: Project Structure for Air Quality Analysis
**Project Overview**<br/>
This project is dedicated to analyzing air quality data using various machine learning techniques. The directory structure is organized into subfolders, each serving a specific purpose in the workflow, from data processing to model development and evaluation. This README file provides an overview of each subfolder and its contents.

Subfolders Explanation
1. data/
Purpose: Contains all datasets used in the project, including raw data, processed data, and any external data sources.

raw/: This folder contains the original, unprocessed datasets. These files are kept unchanged for reference and reproducibility.
processed/: Contains cleaned and preprocessed data that is ready for analysis and modeling.
external/: Includes any data sourced externally, such as from public APIs, government databases, or third-party providers.
README.md: This file provides details on the origin of the datasets, preprocessing steps taken, and instructions on how to add new datasets.

2. notebooks/
Purpose: Hosts Jupyter notebooks used for exploratory data analysis, model development, and documentation of experiments.

exploratory/: Contains notebooks focused on initial data exploration, visualization, and hypothesis generation.
models/: Notebooks dedicated to building and fine-tuning machine learning models. This includes regression, classification, and segmentation models.
README.md: Describes the purpose of each notebook, the sequence in which they should be executed, and any dependencies required.

3. models/
Purpose: Stores trained machine learning models and related artifacts.

regression/: Contains models and results related to regression tasks, such as predicting pollutant levels.
classification/: Includes models and results for classification tasks, such as categorizing air quality levels.
segmentation/: Houses models for segmentation tasks, like identifying pollution hotspots or time periods.
README.md: Provides an overview of each model type, instructions on how to load and use the models, and a summary of model performance metrics.

4. scripts/
Purpose: Contains Python scripts used for various tasks in the project, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

data_preprocessing/: Scripts for cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for analysis.
model_training/: Scripts that automate the process of training machine learning models based on different algorithms.
evaluation/: Contains scripts for evaluating model performance, including generating metrics and visualizations.
README.md: Explains the purpose of each script, how to execute them, and any dependencies or configurations required.

5. reports/
Purpose: Consolidates all final outputs, reports, and visualizations generated throughout the project.

figures/: Stores all plots, charts, and visualizations generated during the analysis and modeling phases.
final_report/: Contains the final report, including all findings, recommendations, and supporting evidence.
README.md: Summarizes the contents of the reports and figures, and provides instructions on how to generate new reports or replicate existing ones.

How to Use This Project
Start with Data: Begin by exploring the datasets in the data/ folder. Use the notebooks in the notebooks/exploratory/ folder to get a sense of the data and identify key variables.
Model Development: Utilize the notebooks in the notebooks/models/ folder to develop and refine your machine learning models. Store trained models in the appropriate subfolder under models/.
Automation: Use the scripts in the scripts/ folder to automate data processing and model training tasks.
Reporting: Generate visualizations and final reports, which will be stored in the reports/ folder.
Contribution Guidelines
Data: Any new datasets should be placed in the appropriate subfolder under data/, and the README.md should be updated to reflect the changes.
Notebooks: New notebooks should be added to the notebooks/ folder with appropriate documentation.
Models: Trained models should be stored in the models/ folder, with corresponding updates to the README.md.
Scripts: New scripts should be added to the scripts/ folder, ensuring they are well-documented and follow project conventions.
