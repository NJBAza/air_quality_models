# README: Project Structure for Air Quality Analysis
**Project Overview**<br/>
This project is dedicated to analyzing air quality data using various machine learning techniques. The directory structure is organized into subfolders, each serving a specific purpose in the workflow, from data processing to model development and evaluation. This README file provides an overview of each subfolder and its contents.

# Limitations of Air Quality Models
## Data Quality and Availability:
1. Incomplete data, for example, respect geolocation or vehicular traffic, or devices errors/calibrations can limit the accuracy of predictions.
2. Lack of real-time data integration might affect the responsiveness of the model to sudden changes in air quality.
3. Models might not adequately represent local variations if the spatial resolution is too coarse.
## Possible Improvements
1. Increase the spatial and temporal resolution of models to capture microclimates and rapid changes better.
2. Use localized models for areas with significant human activity to get more accurate predictions for those regions.
3. Include traffic data, industrial output, and even social media data for real-time incident reporting.
4. Use advanced meteorological modeling to better understand and predict the impact of weather conditions.
5. Develop an integrated system that combines air quality data with public health data to directly correlate pollution levels with health outcomes. Different data sources APIs, etc.
6. Implement real-time data processing and predictive analytics to provide immediate warnings and updates.
7. Leverage IoT and edge computing to process data closer to the source, reducing latency.
# Technical requirements
1. We would require machine learning methodologies to put in production such type of models.
2. It would be important to consider a machine learning architecture to integrate the different data sources with the different stages of the production phase.
3. Continuously monitoring of model performance and data distribution.
4. Real-time or near-to-real-time responses, depending of the final bussiness goal, e.g. reduce the bad quality of air by locations, hours, etc.
5. Track the different models in order to mabage the manage machine learning lifecycle;
6. A/B Testing to verify that different models in fact preserve suitable metrics in real-world scenarios;
7. Integration of different data sources;traffic, industrial outputs, and social media.
